<h1> Flight Price Prediction </h1>
This project focuses on predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a flight ticket based on various features such as the source, destination, date of journey, departure time, arrival time, airline, and other relevant factors.

<h3> Dataset </h3>
The dataset used for this project is stored in an Excel file and contains information about different flights. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, dropping duplicates, and converting relevant features into appropriate formats.

<h3> Data Preprocessing </h3>
The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, dropping duplicates, converting date and time features into a suitable format, and extracting relevant information from the duration feature. Categorical variables are also encoded to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

<h3> Model Implementation  </h3>
Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict flight prices. The models used in this project include Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression. Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as R-squared score and mean absolute error.

<h3> Hyperparameter Tuning  </h3>
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the performance of the models. Randomized search and grid search techniques are used to explore different combinations of hyperparameters and find the best configuration for each model.

<h3> Results  </h3>
The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation results. The chosen model is then used to make flight price predictions.

This project provides a foundation for predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques, and it can be further enhanced by incorporating additional features and exploring advanced algorithms.
